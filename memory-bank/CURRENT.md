- **Latest**: Fixed tsconfig and env variables, created `lcp-optimization` branch

## Recent Accomplishments

### Build Fixes & Branch Management (2025-10-20)
- ✅ **Fixed TypeScript build**: Excluded `doa-website/**/*` from tsconfig to prevent script errors
- ✅ **Restored .env.local**: Added Sanity credentials (public vars) for local builds
- ✅ **Created LCP branch**: Phase 1 optimization work preserved in `lcp-optimization` branch
- ✅ **Main branch clean**: Reset to origin/main, builds successfully
- ✅ **Build verified**: All 12 pages generating successfully

### LCP Performance Optimization - Phase 1 (Branched)
**Branch**: `lcp-optimization`
- ✅ Converted 7 components to React Server Components
- ✅ Implemented parallel server-side data fetching
- ✅ Fixed Portable Text serialization issues
- ✅ Expected impact: LCP 5.0s → 1.5-2.5s (60-70% improvement)
- ✅ Ready for review/merge when needed

### WYSIWYG Rich Text Implementation (2025-10-09)
- ✅ Created RichText component with muted styling for black backgrounds
- ✅ Implemented bodyText and richBodyText Sanity schema types

- ✅ Updated 5 frontend components to render rich text (Projects, Services, Testimonials, AboutCTA, About page)
- ✅ Updated TypeScript types for Portable Text
- ✅ Updated test fixtures and CMS integration tests
- ✅ All tests passing (108/112 passing, 4 unrelated failures)

## Next Steps

### Performance Optimization (Optional)
- [ ] Review `lcp-optimization` branch for potential merge
- [ ] Test LCP improvements on Vercel preview deployment
- [ ] Consider Phases 2-5 from LIGHTHOUSE_LCP_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md

### Environment Configuration
- [ ] Get RESEND_API_KEY from Vercel production environment (for local email testing)
- [ ] Get SANITY_API_TOKEN from Vercel production environment (for local CMS writes)
- Current: API keys empty in local env, but production has them

### Content Management
- [ ] Deploy to production to enable rich text editing in Sanity CMS
- [ ] Content editors can now use bold, italic, and hyperlinks with muted styling

## Technical Notes

### Branch Structure
- **main**: Client-side architecture with HomepageContext, RichText rendering
- **lcp-optimization**: Server Components with parallel data fetching, plain text conversion

### Build Configuration
- TypeScript now excludes: `node_modules`, `scripts/**/*`, `doa-website/**/*`
- Local env has public Sanity vars, production has full API keys

## Blockers
- None
