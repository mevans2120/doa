## Next Steps

### CRITICAL - Email Configuration Required
- [ ] **Verify domain in Resend**: Add DNS records for departmentofart.com
  - Go to https://resend.com/domains
  - Add TXT records for DKIM and SPF
  - Wait for verification (5-10 minutes)
- [ ] **Generate production API key**: Replace test mode key
  - Go to https://resend.com/api-keys
  - Create "DOA Website Production" key
- [ ] **Update environment variables**:
  - `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=contact@departmentofart.com`
  - `RESEND_API_KEY=re_[production_key]`
  - Update both `.env.local` and Vercel dashboard
- [ ] **Test email sending**: Run `node scripts/test-contact-email.js`
- [ ] **Deploy to production**: Push changes and verify in production

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add email monitoring/webhooks (see EMAIL_FIX_PLAN.md Phase 3)
- [ ] Consider adding keyboard navigation (arrow keys) to modal gallery
- [ ] Consider ESC key support to close modal

## Blockers

### Email Configuration Blocker ⚠️
**Issue**: Resend is in test mode with unverified domain
- Current: `onboarding@resend.dev` (test mode)
- Required: `contact@departmentofart.com` (verified domain)
- Impact: Emails will fail until domain is verified
- Resolution: Follow "CRITICAL - Email Configuration Required" steps above
- See: `memory-bank/EMAIL_FIX_PLAN.md` for detailed instructions

## Technical Notes

### What Was Fixed
The contact form had a critical bug where it would return success to users even when emails failed to send. This was caused by:
1. Not checking Resend API error responses
2. Test mode API key with domain restrictions
3. No error logging to diagnose failures

### What Changed
- API route now checks `adminEmailResult.error` and `autoReplyResult.error`
- Admin email failure returns 500 error (CRITICAL - must succeed)
- Auto-reply failure is non-blocking (logs error but returns success)
- All operations logged with timestamps and context
- Emails in logs are sanitized to protect PII

### Testing
- Unit tests: `npm test -- route.test.ts` (10+ test cases)
- Manual tests: `node scripts/test-contact-email.js`
- Build verified: `npm run build` passes
