# TODO Analysis Reports

This directory contains automated TODO/task analysis reports generated by the Project Analyzer skill.

## Files

- **todo-summary-latest.md** - Quick reference with statistics and counts
- **todo-analysis-latest.md** - Full detailed report with all TODOs listed

## How to Update

Run the project analyzer to refresh reports:

```bash
# From project-analyst-manager-Claude skills/project-analyzer directory
npm run analyze -- scan ~/doa -o ~/doa/docs/reports/todo-analysis-latest.md -f markdown -g priority
```

Or simply ask Claude Code:
> "Run project analyzer on DOA and update the reports"

## Report Contents

Each analysis includes:
- Total TODO count
- Priority distribution (High/Medium/Low)
- Type breakdown (TODO, FIXME, Unchecked Task, etc.)
- File locations and line numbers
- Task descriptions

## State Tracking

The analyzer maintains state in `.project-analyzer/state.json` (gitignored) to:
- Prevent duplicate GitHub issues
- Track historical changes
- Enable incremental scanning with `--only-new`

## Last Updated

Check the "Scan Date" in each report file for the last analysis timestamp.
